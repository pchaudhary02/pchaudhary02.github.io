    <h1>C4 Mural</h1>
    <h2>5 days, 12 designers, 1000 sq.feet</h2>

    <p>The mural at Srishti's Trivandrum campus (nicknamed C4) was a collaboration between Barkha Gupta, Antra Khurana, Prathmi Mehta and I, but the result of the effort of 8 other designers. While the four of us worked on the concept, we were assisted with the execuction.</p>

    <p>Working along the lines of developing a techno jungle of sorts, we have tried to infuse the concepts of nature and technology, along with connections with the state of Kerala, to create a mural relevant to the space. A number of elements, like the insects and a few plants, in the piece are purely fictional. A range of patterns inspired by electronics and the digital media were generated to bring these elements together.</p>
