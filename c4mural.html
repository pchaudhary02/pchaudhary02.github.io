    <p>Working along the lines of developing a techno jungle of sorts, we have tried to infuse the concepts of nature and technology, along with connections with the state of Kerala, to create a mural relevant to the space. A number of elements, like the insects and a few plants, in the piece are purely fictional. A range of patterns inspired by electronics and the digital media were generated to bring these elements together.</p>
