    <h1>C4 Mural</h1>
    <h2>5 days, 15 designers, 1000 sq.feet</h2>

    <p>The mural at Srishti's Trivandrum campus (nicknamed C4) is a collaboration between Barkha Gupta, Antra Khurana, Prathmi Mehta and I, but the result of the effort of 11 other designers. While only the four of us worked on the concept, we had assistance with the execuction.</p>

    <p>Working along the lines of developing a techno jungle of sorts, we have tried to infuse the concepts of nature and technology, along with connections with the state of Kerala, to create a mural relevant to the space. A number of elements, like the insects and a few plants, in the piece are purely fictional. A range of patterns inspired by electronics and the digital media were generated to bring these elements together.</p>
