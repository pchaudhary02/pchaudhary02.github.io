        <h1>The Cabal Trunks Project for Jaypore</h1>
        <p>The Cabal Trunks Project is the standing title for the systems and service design project I undertook for the online handicrafts company Jaypore. The intent behind this idea started with the need to make their packaging more sustainable, not only ecologically but emotionally as well.</p>

        <p>Cabal Trunks is a personalized shopping service offered to Jaypore clients who have proved their loyalty to the brand. It works in two ways - at home, with a trunk (the assigned stylist sends the client a trunk of handpicked clothing straight to their doorstep. The client keeps and pays for whatever he/she likes and sends back the rest in the trunk) or at the TrunkShows (shows are organised every three months at the home of a volunteer client. This is an opportunity to meet other members of the Cabal while the stylists will showcase a selection of clothes that fits the clientsâ€™ size, style and spending preferences).</p>
                
        <p>TrunkShows compliment the Cabal Trunks service to form a system environment that is designed to ensure that the packaging is returned to Jaypore and then reused, and yet differentiate the online shopping experience. Although this service is not promoted as being central to returnable packaging, it was created to ensure that that happens, even if only as a byproduct.1</p>
